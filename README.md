# JPplusHouses

First of all, a big thanks to all those in the Credits, for your great work which made this possible. I take no credit for sprites in this set which belong to the great artists involved.

## What is this set?

* In summary, it is essentially the offspring of **Japanese Buildings Set** and **Improved Town Layouts (ITL), or ITL Houses** if they were to have a kid together.

* [Improved Town Layouts](https://github.com/2TallTyler/improved_town_layouts) is a house replacement set, using vanilla game sprites, with a series of rules applied regarding the placement of buildings.

* This set applies many of the same rules, changes some and adds some more - to buildings from the Japanese Buildings Set.

## Credits

### Japanese Buildings Set

* Building Sprites coming for the Japanese Building Set, which itself includes Sprites from Total Town Replacement Set.

### Improved Town Layouts

* Thanks to 2TallTyler for this set. This set, like ITL does, does not modify the behavior of other House Sets.
