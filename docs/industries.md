# Industries

## Background
* I like to play using Game Scripts, especially Renewed Village Growth ("RVG")
* RVG is pretty punishing when category goals are not met, greatly restricting town growth
* Instead of funding industries which accpet cargo from each category, I wanted to provide an 'easy' way to meet cargo objstives using the house set
